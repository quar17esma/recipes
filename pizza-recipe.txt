Ingredients:
- 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)
- package (2 1/4 teaspoons) of active dry yeast
- 3/4 cups (490 g) bread flour
- Tbsp olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)
- teaspoons salt
- teaspoon sugar

Directions:
1.Pizza dough is a yeasted dough which requires active dry yeast. Make sure the check the expiration date on the yeast package! Yeast that is too old may be dead and won't work.

2.You can use all purpose flour instead of the bread flour that is called for in the recipe, but bread flour is higher in gluten than all-purpose flour and will make a crispier crust for your pizza.

3.Cup measurements can vary depending on how you are scooping the flour (we fluff the flour, lightly scoop it, and level with a knife). So I recommend using a kitchen scale to measure out the flour amounts by weight. This is the only way you'll get a consistently accurate measurement.
